              </div>
                <p>First of all, creating many movies does not directly relate to a successful film industry. We have to take a closer look, how the US produced movies are actually performing. And since money rules the world…</p>
                <img src="img/gifs/money.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="350" height="200">
                <p>… let’s start with having a look at the box office revenue of the movies. While comparing the box office of American movies to non-American movies. The median of US produced movies is 10.76 million USD and a mean of 48.81 million USD (with standard deviation of 34.99 million USD) whereas non US produced movies have a median of 5.19 million USD and a mean of 16.81 million USD (with standard deviation of 34.99 million USD). However, co-productions between the US and other countries seem to be the most successful movie formats since they generate the highest box office. Here, the median and the mean are 23.00 and 76.13 million USD respectively. 
                </p>
                <p> The most successful movie in terms of box office revenue was a movie produced in a coproduction of the US and other countries with a box office revenue of 2787.28 million USD (status 2012). Do you know which one it is? - exactly, AVATAR! </p>
                <img src="img/movies/avatar.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="300" height="200">
                <p>Therefore, there are a few very successful movies which create a heavy tailed and right-skewed distribution. This means that median and mean are rather meaningless to describe the data and no causality can be derived anyways. Nonetheless, the differences in box office revenue between US-only produced and between movies produced elsewhere in the world are remarkable. Intriguing… okay, let’s dive deeper into the data.
                </p>
                 <!-- MOVIE RUNTIME  -->
                <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 50px;">

                </div>
                <p> How long are American and non-American movies in terms of movie runtime? In the early 20th century, the movies were kept rather short compared to today. Many had a duration of about 20 to 40 minutes. But there exists also very long movies such as “Modern Times Forever” produced in 2011, which has a duration of 10 days!</p>
                <img src="img/gifs/tired.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="350" height="200">
                <p>Discarding these exceptions and keeping only movies with a runtime of 60 to 180 minutes, the mean and median reveal that US-only produced movies last slightly shorter than co-productions with the US or non-American movies with means of 84, 99 and 98 minutes respectively (the standard deviation is about 30 minutes for the entire dataset, which is rather high). Looking at the distribution of the movie runtimes, it seems that they follow approximately a normal distribution with the exception of US-only produced movies which show a bimodal distribution with a peak around 20 minutes. Apparently, there is a tendency that US-produced movies are shorter than movies produced elsewhere. But let’s recall that most of the movies produced in the early 20th centuries are American movies and that back in those days, the movie duration was about 20 minutes. That is where this second peak must come from.

            </div>
              <p>What was neglected until now, is the opinion of the spectator. What if the box office revenue is not actually representative for the popularity of a movie? Let’s inspect - using the IMDb dataset for movies, which contains the IMDb rating for each movie with a value ranging from 0 to 10 - how American and non-American films are rated by the spectators. The statistics do not reveal any preferences related to the production country of the movies. US produced, partially US-produced, and non-US produced movies all have similar mean, median, and standard deviation with ratings located around 6. The histogram  for the average IMDb rating for US-only produced movies follows a normal distribution. On the contrary, the average IMDb rating for partially US-produced and  non-US produced movies are slightly right skewed. Hmmm… the conspiracy theory starts losing its apparent importance. If the spectator does not let himself influence in his preferences for American movies, then where is the hypothesized influence of the US?  But wait. We can’t yet draw any conclusions from these first statistics.  </p>
             <img src="img/gifs/conspiracy.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="350" height="200">
             <p>The influence of America might depend on several aspects, as for example the culture of the spectator. For instance, in Sydney, audiences generally prefer American films over locally produced movies. So stay tuned, we’re not yet at the end of the exploration of the concerned research question. 
             </p>
             <img src="img/movies/movies_boxoffice_timeseries.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=other  width="1000" height="1000" > <!-- image when clicking on the link -->
             <p>Let’s again have a closer look at the development of the yearly box office revenues of movies produced in the US compared to movies from other production countries. The plot on the left shows that the average box office revenue of American movies is higher than the one of movies produced outside the US. However, it seems that there is an exception in the 70es where movies from the rest of the world have in average an importantly bigger box office revenue than American movies. This matches with the decrease in movie production in the 70’s observed in the histogramme above.</p>
             <p> Starting from the 80s, American movies took over the lead again and the average box office revenue has increased until today. But so does the error (filled plots) which reminds us that a few very successful American movies increase the mean considerably. The right plot indicates that the box office revenue of partially-American produced movies develops similarly to strictly-American produced movies, although the coproductions overtop the american movies from time to time with some fluctuation. However, since 2000, it seems that producing a film only partially in the US is beneficial in terms of yearly average box office revenues. This can be explained by the fact that nowadays, movies are generally not only produced in one country since many virtual effects companies are taking contracts worldwide. Furthermore, it might be cheaper to produce movies partially out of the US because of cheaper labor.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Now, let’s recall that the availability of movies in commonly spoken languages is important for their success. Therefore, this section is dedicated to the languages in which movies are translated. How are the US using translations to export their movies and spread their culture?</p>
          
             <!-- Changer ca  -->
            <iframe src="img/movies/interactive_languages.html" class="centered-iframe" scrolling="yes" width="600" height="600" ></iframe>

            <p>We observe on the figure above that 50% of the movies are available in English. Assuming that most of American people only speak fluently English, that means that "only" half of the produced movies are accessible to this population. 
              Let’s also recall that not everybody is fluent in English even though it is the international language. For instance, China, 18% of the population of this planet, is ranked #82 in the Education English First Proficiency Index. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/gifs/mary-poppins.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="350" height="200">
            <p>Translating a movie to English is therefore a way to make it international for foreigners speaking English, but also to make it available for American people. To target a specific country, the movies would better be translated into the language.s spoken there.
              Hence, we could be wondering if a movie available in English generates more money than a movie not available in English? The plot below reveals that the box office revenue is significantly higher for movies available in English compared to those without (p-value = 4.1e-10). However, that does not yet mean that there is a causality relation. 
            </p>
            <iframe src="img/movies/interactive_boxplot_English_and_boxoffice.html"class="centered-iframe" scrolling="no" width="1100" height="550"></iframe>
            <p>Now focusing on the movies produced strictly by the US, to what extend are they exported abroad ? Is it genre-dependent ?
              To answer these questions, the movies were grouped by genre and the number of translations of the movies were summed up.
              The plot below shows the top 10 of the genres cumulating the most translations among US movies, and the corresponding number of translations for movies partially produced by the US.
            </p>
            <img src="img/movies/drama_US_translations.png"class="centered-iframe" scrolling="no" width="1100" height="550"></iframe>
            <p>As the plot reveals, the genre “drama” contains the most US movies translated to other languages. The partially US-produced movies don’t follow the same trend even though the 2 most translated genres are the same for both strictly and partially US-produced movies. Assuming that translation numbers are related to the export of movies, one can deduce from this plot that US drama movies are by far the most exported (and maybe appreciated!) genre worldwide and thus, the US spread their culture through the export of these movies. Wow, this finding introduces some new spice to our conspiracy theory!

            </div>
            <p>As we were already discussing, the number of movies produced by the US does not yet say anything about their influence on the world. The success of those American movies worldwide is much more important than only the number of productions. The IMDb rating can be helpful to grasp a more meaningful insight into the influence of US-produced movies. However, not all movies dispose of an IMDb score. In order to compare the success of movies, we therefore create a success index for movies - the Movie Success Index (MSI) - that is based on the existing IMDb ratings to have more movies in our dataset which we can compare to each other with their success. 
            </p>
            <p>The implementation of the Movie Success Index is based on a linear regression to predict the IMDb ratings. The variables chosen to craft the new index are the logarithm of the box office revenue, the names of the actors, the runtime, the countries of production and the available languages (i.e. translations). Below is a list with the 10 largest weights resulting from this regression with very interesting factors:

            <h4> Top 10 biggest weights in the linear regression of IMDb ratings</h4>
          <p>Most of these parameters are genres or languages. By far, gay themed movies seem to be better rated. Lots of drama subcategories are also represented. Recalling our previous analysis on production of drama movies in the US, which was the major genre produced and exported by this country, it makes sense that drama movies are extensively produced since there are particularly appreciated by the public.

          <h4>9 Dead Gay Guys (2002) </h4>
          <p>Unfortunately, the fitted model is only explaining 47% (R2) of the variance of the IMDB during 5-fold cross validation, so we cannot assume that the resulting index is a good prediction of IMDb rating. However, we don’t need to predict accurately the IMDb, but we were looking for a metric to predict and compare the success of movies. Although the predictions did not show any outliers (they were bounded between a value of 3 and 9 for the IMDb score), the predictions were still rearranged on the central 95% of the total range of the predicted values and re-scaled in the [0;100] interval to calculate the MSI. This is implemented to handle potential outliers and to have a spread distribution in the final MSI range. In this context, we call ‘outlier’ a predicted value out of the range [0,10], i.e. out of the range of the IMDb scores.
          </p>
          <p>Now, we can calculate the MSI for all the movies in the dataset, which contain the chosen input features but have no IMDb rating available. The plot below shows the distribution of the predicted MSI for all the movies in the dataset containing the necessary features. The predictions did not generate any outliers.</p>
          <img src="img/movies/MSI_distribution.png"class="centered-iframe" scrolling="no" width="1100" height="550"></iframe>
           <p>The MSI of the extended dataset follows a very slightly right skewed, showing that some movies still tends be more popular.
            But keeping in mind our initial question, is there a difference in MSI between the US-produced movies and the movies produced outside of the US? Let’s check: A t-test puts into evidence that in contrast to what we have seen until now, movies produced outside the US are significantly more successful according to MSI with a p-value of 1.1e-32. This surprising result could be explained that the US are producing lots of movies as seen before and that lots of poor-quality movies are produced, pulling the mean MSI.
            The timeline below shows the development of the predicted MSI in time. This timeline is consistent with the previous results: in the 70’s, the movies produced outside the US are quite likely to have a MSI superior to the US movies. The trend in the beginning of the timeline is not clear since very few movies outside of the US (in the rest of the world) were produced at that time. Furthermore, the timeline reveals that especially in recent years, the popularity of American movies seems to decline. Interesting. Is this weakening the conspiracy theory that the US is influencing the world importantly?
             For all the sceptics, we jump to the next component of our analysis: the careers of actors and actresses.

          <p> A country’s influence in the cinema industry is not only seen through filmmaking or cast, but also, through movie plots. Often forgotten, this aspect might actually be the greatest source of influence in cinema. You often don’t remark the movie origin or the actors’ nationalities, but what you do see is the film, and with it the plot put to life. You remember the love life of Scarlett O’Hara during the American civil war, the New York of West Side Story or the famous 5$ milkshakes in Pulp Fiction… In fact, the narratives portrayed in cinema play a significant role in shaping and perpetuating the myth of the "American way of life". </p>
          <p>To analyze the role of the USA in movies, we will take a closer look at synopses. Shorter to interpret than full movie scripts, synopses are still retaining the main traits of the movies they depict. Indeed, synopsis summarize film content since the early days, to attract viewers to the silver screens. For us customers, synopses are also an efficient tool to choose the right film. Without them, we’d have to rely on the film poster and the movie name, and God knows where we would end.

          <p>So, we thought we’d analyze the plot summaries of 42,208 movies (!!!!) - the same we analyzed in Movies - to understand if we can see any difference depending on the movie origin. Let's get started before the Shining eats us...</p>

            <p> The main metrics, presented in the table, do not provide clear insights on USA influence. Movies only produced in the USA exhibit a wider range of synopsis lengths, and the synopses are generally longer than the ones with non American origins (higher mean and median). But, partially-US movies exhibit the highest median and mean for all three origins. 
            </p>
            <p> An average synopsis is, overall, as long a scientific paper (but hopefully more entertaining !)- around 1000 words. But, synopses have a skewed distribution of lengths, shown by the inequality of mean and median, for all three origins. A reason should be found for such behaviour, and probably the synopsis length depends on the type and theme of movies.</p>
            <img src="img/plots/summaries_word_interval.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="1050" height="650">
             <p>As the simple statistics were not conclusive, let’s look at the synopsis length repartition, a better option for skewed data. Those repartitions are shown above, following as always the movies origins. </p>
            <p> Well, nothing more enlightening here it seems :(. As expected, very few movie summaries have less than 20 words and more than 2000 - a behaviour shared across all origins. Movie produced only the United States have 7% more synopses over 500 words, compared to non-US ones. But, still, partially-US movies distinguish with the longest synopses, over 500 words, as presented before. </p>
            <p>Therefore, we see a difference in synopses following movie origin, but we cannot state on the actual impact of America in synopses by this sole analysis. Prepare your shovels, we are gonna dig hard…</p>

          <!-- USA IN SYNOPSIS -->
              <p>Being very frustrated with the previous outputs, we bring out the big guns, aka. the Natural Language Processing toolbox. So, we will process each summary and check out for two interesting things : 1. Locations and 2. Words depicting the USA and their culture. It's basically honey for bees here...so if we cannot catch the US influence with those two, well it’s probably that the US influence is not as omnipresent as they’d like us to believe…Sorry US buddies, I know it hurts.</p>

                <h3> US locations in synopsis </h3>
                 <p>Ok, so,  to assess the presence of the USA in movie summaries, what better thing than calculating the proportion of US geopolitical entities (GPE) -relative to all other locations found - in each synopsis. Clear as crystal isn’t it ?!
                </p>
                <p>But, wait a sec, how does my algo identify locations ? An accurate one I mean, so that all the Paris Hiltons and Austin Butlers do not accidentally end up as locations… Well, well, well, for this, we have the Transformer NLP processor,  a powerful tool that uses context to retrieve only true locations. Ok, one problem solved.
                </p>
                <p>Now, to check if the identified locations are Americans or not, you’d say : “Eazy peazy, prepare a list of the states, counties and main cities of the US and check if your locations correspond”. Ok, but what if the location is not in the list ? And what about London, Cairo, Athens, Utah.. and all those locations that exist both in the United States and elsewhere  ? … …. Nothing ? Well, we have something : Geopy nominatim, a Python extension that outputs the most probable address for a given location. For example, given ‘London’ it outputs ‘London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom’ and some small city in the US. On the contrary, for ‘Utah’, Geopy generates ‘Utah, United States’, like we would have said. Then, we only need to check if the Geopy output contains ‘United States’. Huurrrayy !!!! 

                  After some test, we only identified ‘Palestine’ as being incorrectly classified as a US locations, possibly because it's existence is not recognised all existing countries. But, overall, synopses are short and fast read summaries of a movie, so it’s very unlikely that an ambiguous improbable location is mentioned. So, we are quite satisfied with our solution, slower but more accurate, and we can jump on to the results.

                <p>Looking at the basic statistics on the percentages of American culture, we see that the median is zero,  for all production types. This unusual result just means that a lot of movies don't contain any US locations in their plot summaries. But caution, this result also includes the synopses where no existing location was mentioned ! Think about dystopias like “Hunger Games” or science fictions like “Star Wars”...
                </p>
                <p>Now, looking at the means, we can notice that US-only produced movies show the highest percentage of American culture with 36.7 %. This means that movies produced in the US tend on average to tell a story that takes place at least partially in the US. Next, the partially US-produced movies show on average a percentage of American locations of 27 %, that means 9 % less American locations compared to US-only produced movies. And, for movies produced outside of the US, this proportion is even lower : 4.8 % of American locations only, so around 9 times less than US-only movies and 7 times less than the partially-US ones. So, we have a trend !!! Isn’t that great ?!! OK, let’s keep calm, by looking at the distributions, but sometimes you see, basic stats do not give you the whole picture. All the more that, the standard deviation is important, probably because of the “small number bias”. Indeed, among all words in synopses, only a fraction are locations and even less American ones, easily skewing the stats. 
                </p>
                <img src="img/plots/summaries_distribution_GPE.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="850" height="750">
                <p>So, the distributions of US locations. Interestingly, they appear bimodal, for all three origins. At first, we observe that more than 50% of all US-only produced movies don't contain any US locations in the plot summaries. But a substantial part of 30% of the US-only movies happen exclusively on US territory. The partially US produced movies follow the same pattern but with a slightly increased proportion of movies not happening on US territory. Finally, the plot to the right shows that 90% of all movies produced strictly outside the US don't talk about US geographic locations.
                  So, pretty much the same interpretations here. The more a movie is American, the more it talks about the US. Ok, maybe that was an obvious one. BUT, what’s also interesting is that foreign movies are actually evoking the US very little.
                  </p>
                <img src="img/plots/summeries_timeseries_GPE.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="1100" height="750">
                <p>Over time, we also see that, on average, US locations have become more present in US-only movies, since the 20s. For partially-US movie, this trend is emerging later, near 1960. Interestingly, those time periods both set the boundaries of the Golden age of Hollywood (1920-60).
                </p>
                <p>But, does that really mean that the US are not so present in worldwide movies? Think about your classics, from “American Pie” to “The Green Mile” and “Pulp Fiction”, and you’d see this is could not be this simple.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-12 text-justify">
                <h3> American culture in synopsis  </h3>
                <p>Locations are a good tool to check if a lot of movies were clearly mentioning the USA in their synopses. But, cultural influence is usually much more powerful than that. Think cookies for example, a typical American word that we use daily without clearly mentioning or even thinking about the US. This more discreet effect is what we want to investigate now.</p>
                <p>For this study, we confide in ChatGPT to output a list of 200 words representing American culture. Indeed, no database is available on such  a specific matter and machine learning techniques were considered out-of-scope here. Rather than making our own list of words, bearing a huuuge bias, we preferred generating a list using an artificial intelligence tool that has actually seen thousands of texts related to American culture. We keep in mind that a bias is probably present too, but we estimated it was much lower than ours. In addition, we are also conscious about the relatively small size of the list supposed to "capture" the American culture. Hopefully the American culture is richer than those 200 words but time processing constraints restricted the list size. 
                  The words included a variety of references, from food (“milkshake”, “burger”...) to  brands (“harley davidson”, “cadillac”..), events (“homecoming”, “election”, “state fair”), values, famous people.... 
                  
                  Similarly as for the GPEs, we calculated the percentage of American culture, here using the proprotion between the number of words present in the list of 200 American words and the total number of words per summary. 
                </p>
                <!-- <img src="img/plots/macdo.jpg" width="10%">-->
                <img src="img/plots/summaries_distribution_lexicon.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="850" height="750">
                 <p>Contrary to the GPEs, the American words are presenting a normal distribution (less obvious for the partially-US movies though). More precisely, it appears 36.16% of US-only movies, 36.15% of partially-US movies and only 17.21% of foreign synopses exhibit at least 1 word from the American culture list. As the list also contains generic words like “president” or “motorcycle club”, other statistics may be more relevant. 
                </p>
                <p>By looking at the mean and median, we observe both are close to 0, explaining the normal distribution. These very low values can be explained similarly as for the American locations, with a lot of synopses not containing any word from the lexicon. The maximum value is also much lower, because the total number of words per synopsis is much larger than the total number of locations per synopsis. Therefore, the percentage of American culture also suffers from this “small number bias”.

                <p>But, what’s important is to note that American culture is more present in US-only movies (higher max and higher mean) than in partially-US, and in even more than in foreign movies. So, foreign movies use words related to American culture to describe their movies, but to an extent that seems negligible (on average 0.25% American words per summary).</p>
                <img src="img/plots/summaries_timeseries_lexicon.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="1100" height="750">
                <p> Interestingly, the presence of American culture for the three types of movie origins has not evolved much over time. Foreign movies have always used the least American words, especially between 1920 and 2015. Therefore, the worldwide American influence has not increased since 1920, or, is not traduced by movie synopses. For the partially-American movies, the percentage of American culture has increased since 1945, to reach nearly US-only levels. The trend can be explained by the increased importance of partially-American movies, in exponential growth since the 1940s, or by a greater influence of the USA over time. Probably both actually…

            <p>Many actors and actresses have had more or less successful careers in their lifetime. In fact, the CMU dataset contains information on more than 450 000 actors and actresses. But probably just a few of them are known on a larger scale. Are the known ones Americans or actors playing in American films? To understand, to what extent the US influences the global cinema industry (and thus maybe our minds… ATTENTION ATTENTION), the following analysis is dedicated to the career of American actors and actresses compared to the non-American ones.

              <h3>Importing actors nationalities</h3>
              <p>First of all, the CMU dataset does not contain information about the nationality of the actors and actresses. To conduct the planned analysis anyways, we created a function for a SPARQL query which scraps Wikipedia pages using DBpedia to extract the nationality of the actors in the dataset. More precisely, the query adds to the dataset the nationality “American” if the actor is from the US and it adds “Other” as nationality if this is not the case. This procedure enriches the CMU dataset for the character metadata with the nationality and enables us to depthen our analysis.
              </p>
              <p>The percentage of American actors in the CMU dataset is about 36% (absolute value: 161'386 actors), whereas 33% (absolute value: 146’768 actors) of the actors are coming from “Other” countries. The remaining 31% don’t contain any information about nationality after the Wikipedia scraping, which means, they contain NaN values. This high percentage of NaN values is not favorable for the exploration of our research questions but we can still use nationality for further analysis. 
              </p>
              <p>Exploring how the two groups, American and non-American actors, look like, we group by nationality and inspect the distribution of age and proportion of gender. Those variables will serve for our in-depth study and we need to verify if the distributions/proportions are similar between the two partitions of the dataset. If not, we would need to account for the difference when analyzing and drawing conclusions on the data. With a first simple data exploration, focusing on our main variables of interest (nationality, age, gender), we find that the distribution of age and gender is similar for both American and non-American actors. This finding is reassuring for our further analysis that both groups are comparable in their features. The gender ratio (female to male) is 0.53 and 0.51 for American and non-American actors respectively. Furthermore, the age distribution seems to follow a normal law, slightly right-skewed, - an interesting insight that we will explore later on. Again we find an allegedly impressive domination of the US in movie casts. But we have to stay cautious since the high employment of American actors for movies worldwide might come from the fact that a high ratio of movies are produced in the States and therefore might cast preferentially American actors.

             <h3>Actors nationalities following movies origin</h3>
              <p>Going a little bit deeper in the analysis, we explore data proportions taking into consideration both actor nationality and film origin. This step will serve to disentangle the links between both variables. We specifically focus on those two variables to assess the influence of the movie origin on an actor's career (and success) and the factors (like actors’ nationality) that might affect this link. The outcome is mirroring our expectations for the foreign actors. Indeed, Foreign actors are mostly playing in foreign movies. On the other hand, American actors are playing as much in movies with US origin (including both only US and partially US) as in movies not originating from the US. Interestingly, American actors don't play that frequently in US-only movies.</p>  
              <p>As the dataset contains roughly the same number of US and Foreign actors, we can deduce from this that US actors are more often exported to the rest of the world than Foreign actors are imported to the US, i.e. we have a net flux of actors exporting from the US to the rest of the world - from a movie making perspective. In a later step, we will also put those figures in relation to the pie chart showing the fraction of movies per origin.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-12 text-justify">
              <h3> Which kind of actor plays in which kind succesful movies ? </h3>
              <p>Good, the dataset seems balanced. Nice. And in our dataset, we have approximately as many American actors as foreign actors but this is not yet containing any evidence about the predominance of America in global cinema through American actors. If these actors play in movies, which don’t have any popularity and are not watched by a large audience, the actors can’t have any influence on the global film industry. That’s why we inspect which actors play in successful films in terms of box office revenue. Specifically, we want to see if foreign actors typically play in movies with higher box office revenue than American ones.This procedure will provide a first overview, but later on we will examine the success of actors based on more features, and therefore more broadly supported. 
              </p>
              <p>Having checked the balance of the dataset, we now analyze both groups of actors - American and foreign actors - in terms of the box office revenue of the movies produced in the US and produced in the rest of the world. When looking at the results for the basic statistical values, we focus our comparison on the median since the data is right skewed. American actors play in American movies with median box office revenue of 18 million USD and in non-American movies with median box office revenue of 9 million USD. Meanwhile, Foreign actors play in American movies with median box office revenue of 21 million USD and in non-American movies with median box office revenue of 7 million USD. For both Foreign & American actors, it seems that playing in American movies (either partially or only US produced) generates a higher median box office revenue, compared to playing in movies produced in the rest of the world. Also, it looks like actors playing in movies of a different origin than theirs (that is, American actors playing in rest of the world movies and vice versa) are associated with higher median box office revenues. Finally, movies co-produced by the US have, for both nationality groups, the highest revenues among all movie origins. However, in the case of co-produced movies, American actors play in movies with higher box offices (so "more successful" movies) than foreign actors. In conclusion, no clear trend can be identified regarding whether an actor's origin influences their likelihood of being cast in a successful movie.

                   <!-- Does gender matters  -->
              <div class="col-lg-12 text-justify">
              <h3> Does gender matter ? </h3>
              <p> The analysis of gender distribution among U.S. and foreign actors reveals a similar pattern across all three movie origin groups: female actors represent about 30%, while male actors account for roughly 60%. Interestingly, the gender imbalance is more pronounced in strictly U.S. movies, particularly among U.S. actors compared to foreign actors. Given that all movie origins show the same distribution, does this pattern stem from movies produced in America? While the present analysis cannot answer this question, it does add a twist to the conspiracy theory.
              </p>
              <p>Gender differences in casting may also relate to box office revenue, beyond the production country. Since the focus remains on America’s influence, we analyzed gender representation in box office revenue across age groups.
              </p>
              <p>For foreign women, films with lower box office revenue dominate across all age groups older than 20, contrasting with men. This trend does not hold for American actors, where men only appear slightly more often in higher-revenue films in the 10–69 age range.
              </p>
              <p>For both nationalities, the oldest actors see very high revenues. These anomalies may stem from the small number of older actors, who are likely skilled performers cast in successful films. Highly successful actors are also more likely to remain in the industry later in life than their less successful counterparts."</p>

              <h3> Is an early career more likely for American actors ?
                And does American nationality helps kicking off actors' careers? </h3>
              <p>For now, the results of the analysis are rather relieving and speak against the conspiracy theory. Phew! But we want evidence so we’re not yet at the end of the analysis. What if the career start of actors depends on their nationality? Let’s explore if it helps to kick-off an acting career when being American. For this purpose, the career of an actor is defined as the number of movies played in whereas an early career is defined as an actor playing the first time in a movie before the age of 18. 
              </p>
              <p>In general, looking at the age variable, the metrics confirm that we have very similar age distributions following the actors’ nationalities (similar mean, median, std, max, min for both nationalities). What we see is that US actors are generally younger if casted in US movies (and even younger if the film is only produced in the US). The contrary is true for Foreign actors, who are on average younger in non-US produced movies.
              </p>
              <p>To answer our question, we then looked at the percentage of actors acting in a movie before this age and we confirmed that US actors are more inclined to having an early career in all movie producing countries, with a significant difference in US only produced movies (9.14% of US actors vs 4.5% of foreign actors having an early career). The box office trend by actor age (Fig) also suggests that these early birds also get the best movies if they are American! To understand whether early careers actually helped US actors in kicking off their careers, we did a further analysis by computing the correlation coefficients between the age at the first movie and the total number of movies for each actor. </p>

              <p> We obtained in both cases negative correlation coefficients, meaning that an earlier starting is indeed related to a richer career in terms of number of movies played.</p>

               <h3>Does acting in an US movie help in kicking off the acting career?</h3>
               <p>Now we want to investigate how much acting in a US movie counts on actors' CVs. To do so, we compute, for each actor, the mean IMBd ratings of films in which they act before and after acting in their first (strictly) US movie. The results are clear: 94.45% of the actors saw an increase of the average rating after acting in a US movie. So suggestion: if you are an actor looking for work opportunities, why not cheat in your CV by adding a role in a US movie ;)

              <p>I know I know, if you arrived at this point you just want to see the famous Actor Success Index (ASI) . We promised to have answers about the conspiracy theory, but we have one more step to go. We were curious to know about possible stereotypes of actors casted for different movie origins, so we decided to look for clusters in career types based on career length, number of movies and age at first movie.
              </p>
              <img src="img/actors/actors_kmeans.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="other" width="650" height="600">
              <p>The analysis gave us 5 interesting clusters that we interpreted, by looking at the centroids, as follow:
              </p>
              <p>Cluster 0: "The One-Hit Wonder" — A brief but impactful appearance before disappearing.
              </p>
              <p>Cluster 1: "The Marathoner" — A relentless actor in it for the long haul.
              </p>
              <p>Cluster 2: "The Shooting Star" — A bright spark that burned out too soon.</p>
              <p>Cluster 3: "The Late Bloomer" — Got in the game late but left their mark.</p>
              <p>Cluster 4: "The Child Prodigy Turned Legend" — Started young, stayed strong, and never left the spotlight.
              </p>
              <p>We can see that “The One-Hit Wonder” is definitely the favourite type of career for the two groups of actors, although foreigners strongly prevail, maybe not realising that this might be an unsuccessful type of career. Contrairly, a successful path seems to be the fourth cluster, although hard to get, but in which, guess what, Americans prevail!

              <p>We are finally at the end of our investigation. Given the findings above, we collected all the information that appeared important to define an actor’s career and we used it to predict a success index. But how could we prove globally the success of an actor? We decided to look at the results of the most famous film awards in the world: the Golden Globes. It is an annual award ceremony held since 1944 to honor artists and their works. In particular, based on the nominations and the results of each year, the points for theGolden Globe index (our ‘ground truth’) were assigned as follow: 0 points if never nominated; 1 point if at least once nominated; 2 points if at least once won; 3 points if more than once won.</p>
              <p> An ordered regression model was used to predict the success index using the Golden Globe index as target and the following features were fitted as dependent variables: gender of actor, height of actor, age at first movie, number of movies played, number of famous movies played and career’s length. Before fitting the model, the dataset was downsampled to balance the significantly bigger number of actors having Golden Globe index of 0. The final fit gave an accuracy of 85.25% on the test set and presented the following coefficients:
